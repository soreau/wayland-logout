.Sh NAME
.Nm wayland-logout
.Nd generic logout utility for wayland compositors
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a compositor agnostic utility for simulating a
logout with any wayland compositor.
.Pp
It sends a
.Sy SIGINT
.Xr signal 3
to the running compositor
.Sy PID
which is obtained by looking at the
.Sx environment
variables.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses the
.Ev WAYLAND_DISPLAY
and
.Ev XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
environment variables to get the
.Xr socket 2
corresponding to the compositor instance.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 1 if an error has occurred along with
the error reasoning and exits with 0 on success.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To kill the current compositor instance, run inside
the compositor environment:
.Dl $ wayland-logout
.Pp
A typical use case, to kill a specific compositor
instance of another user (with uid=1002), run as
the other user (or as root):
.Dl $ env -i XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1002 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-4 wayland-logout
or
.Dl $ WAYLAND_DISPLAY=/run/user/1002/wayland-4 wayland-logout
